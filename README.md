# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Image classification on the CIFAR 10 Dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Fully Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The files are organized as follows:

SVMs_Part1 -- Image Classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset using Support Vector Machines. Different types of kernels are used including Linear Kernel, Polynomial Kernel and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel.

SVMs_Part2_PCA -- Image Classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset using Support Vector Machines. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction. The number of dimensions are chosen based on the cumulative explained variance. Results for the following dimensionality reductions are shown:

| Number of Components  | Percentage variance explained |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 150  | 93.1  |
| 500  | 98.5  |


See "Final_Report.pdf" for an analysis of the efficacy of the various algorithms on the CIFAR-10 Image Classification task.
